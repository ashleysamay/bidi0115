## Owlbert Walking Guides 🚶‍♀️

We believe the best way to see a city is by walking 👣, and why not do that with Owlbert as your guide? Our API connects with most map apps so Owlbert can easily share fun facts and recommendations while your listeners can ensure that they don't get lost!

## Owlbert Audio Guides 🎧

Owlbert's a real hoot (get it?!). But really, Owlbert's audio guides make it even easier—and lots more fun—to navigate a new city. Owlbert's audio guides are like if an audio book and a music playlist had a baby. They're fact-filled and song-filled, and perfect for listening to on the go!
